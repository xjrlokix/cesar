# The Cesar Project

A sandbox Ember application based on the smashing magazin article http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/07/an-in-depth-introduction-to-ember-js/

## Install

The following tools are needed to make it work

1. npm / node.js

2. bower

3. grunt

4. apache

## How to

1. npm install

2. bower install
... Attention: when this was coded, bower had ember-data in the version 0.14 which made problems. See index.html source code. Manualy update to ember-data 1.0.0beta3

3. grunt

You should have a templates.js and a cesar.js in the base directory now. The entry point is the index.html
